# News-Saturation

## Introduction 

This repository contains source code and tools for research around a phenomenon I call **news saturation**.

News saturation is not a new phenomenon, but it has been more apparent since the 2016 US presidential election. It happens when a particular topic or story is disproportionately covered by the news media. This results in casual observers of the news not getting a full picture of important events affecting their lives because too many news media resources are being used to cover the saturation topic.

Many important events of great consequence happened silently in the maelstrom of the election and the days since Donald Trump took office. 

### Tools and methods

A big part of this research will be the regular collection news data from a variety of sources using [**News API**](https://newsapi.org/) and analyzing saturation topics. A shiny app will stream News API data to monitor the news in real time. The news will be collected in a database.

In order to capture more granular changes in news the end goal of news capture would be through the deployment of a web crawler targetting news sites. The *news crawler* is being developed using a python web-crawling framework called [**scrapy**](https://scrapy.org/).
