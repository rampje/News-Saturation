# News-Saturation

## Introduction 

This repository contains source code and tools for research around a phenomenon I call **news saturation**.

News saturation is not a new phenomenon, but it has been more apparent since the 2016 US presidential election. It happens when a particular topic or story is disproportionately covered by the news media. This results in casual observers of the news not getting a full picture of important events affecting their lives because too many news media resources are being used to cover the saturation topic.

Many important events of great consequence happened silently in the maelstrom of the election and the days since Donald Trump took office. Here is a working list of some of these events (not complete obviously):

* Talks to pass TPP summer of 2015 (eventually this became an issue at the end of 2015)
* News about Russian envolvment in election that came out in 2016
* Bill allowing ISPs to sell customer browsing information (occured during coverage of the attempt to vote on healthcare reform bill)

### Tools and methods

A big component of this research is observing daily changes in the news. The current strategy to capture this data is through the deployment of a web crawler targetting news sites and extracting news article data. This data is then filtered, processed, and further analyzed in R.

I am building the web crawlers using a python web-crawling framework called [**scrapy**](https://scrapy.org/). The R code is being stored on [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) files.
